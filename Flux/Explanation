Flux automates the deployment of containers to Kubernetes
• It can synchronise your version control (git) and your Kubernetes cluster
• With flux, you can put manifest files (your kubernetes yaml files) within
your git repository
• Flux will monitor this repository and make sure that what’s in the manifest
files is deployed to the cluster
• Flux also has interesting features where it can automatically upgrade your
containers to the latest version available within your docker repository (it
uses semantic versioning for that - e.g. “~1.0.0”)

Flux has joined the CNCF - Cloud Native Computing Foundation
• They believe in GitOps (from github.com/fluxcd/flux):
• You declaratively describe the entire desired state of your system in git
• What can be described can be automated
• You push code not containers
