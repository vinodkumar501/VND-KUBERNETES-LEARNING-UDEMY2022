https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/daemonset/

Daemon Sets ensure that every single node in the Kubernetes cluster
runs the same pod resource
• This is useful if you want to ensure that a certain pod is running on
every single kubernetes node
• When a node is added to the cluster, a new pod will be started
automatically
• Same when a node is removed, the pod will not be rescheduled on
another node


Typical use cases:
• Logging aggregators
• Monitoring
• Load Balancers / Reverse Proxies / API Gateways
• Running a daemon that only needs one instance per physical instance
