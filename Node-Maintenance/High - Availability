If you’re going to run your cluster in production, you’re going to want to
have all your master services in a high availability (HA) setup
• The setup looks like this:
• Clustering etcd: at least run 3 etcd nodes
• Replicated API servers with a LoadBalancer
• Running multiple instances of the scheduler and the controllers
• Only one of them will be the leader, the other ones are on stand-by

-->
A cluster like minikube doesn’t need HA - it’s only a one node cluster
• If you’re going to use a production cluster on AWS, kops can do the heavy lifting for
you
• If you’re running on an other cloud platform, have a look at the kube deployment
tools for that platform
• kubeadm is a tool that is in alpha that can set up a cluster for you
• If you’re on a platform without any tooling, have a look at http://kubernetes.io/docs/
admin/high-availability/ to implement it yourself
• In the next demo I’ll show you how to modify the kops setup to run multiple master
nodes
