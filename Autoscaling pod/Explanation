Autoscaling
• An example:
• You run a deployment with a pod with a CPU resource request of 200m
• 200m = 200 millicpu (or also 200 millicores)
• 200m = 0.2, which is 20% of a CPU core of the running node
• If the node has 2 cores, it’s still 20% of a single core
• You introduce auto-scaling at 50% of the CPU usage (which is 100m)
• Horizontal Pod Autoscaling will increase/descrease pods to maintain a
target CPU utilization of 50% (or 100m / 10% of a core within this pod)

1vcpu == 1000 millicore cpu

cpu request is 500m == 1/2 of 1 vpcu

cpu 0.5 = 1/2 of 1 vcpu
